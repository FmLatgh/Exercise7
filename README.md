## ASSIGNMENTS
For each lesson there is an assignment in the assignments folder.

If you feel that you need more practice on JavaScript before starting with the assignments:
* Do the (a part of the) exercises in the 0_catch_up_exercises folder first! It also contains the answers.
* Or you can do some extra exercises online via CodeWars: have a look in the 0_COdeWars folder.
