1. Go to <https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-4> and complete exercises 4 to 7:

- Make sure you select 'Options' in the reference on the top left!!
- READ first.
- It\'s about understanding(!) what\'s happening, not about speed.

2. When you\'re done, answer these questions:

- What should you write on the dots to invoke function *increment*?

```html
<button ... >Press me</button\>
```

```javascript
export default {
    data() {
        return {
            count: 0
        }
    },
    increment() {
        // update component state
        this.count++
    }
}
```
