# Practice: Specialisation Web

## Learning goals
* You will be able to write functions in different ways:
You can write function declarations, function expressions and arrow functions.

## ASSIGNMENT
* Open the folder `exercise_different_functions` in Webstorm.
* Try to understand the code in the different files.
* Ask questions if there is something you don't understand.
* Try to run the code in the browser. One square is spinning, the other are not.
* Try to fix the code so that all squares are spinning. Read the TODO's in the code to do that.
* If an error is shown in the developer tools, try to understand the error message.
* Then fix the error by debugging the code (set a breakpoint, use the console, etc.).
