  <h2>3. How Long We Keep Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Personal data will be kept for the time necessary for the provision of the platform and services. Random Team Generator may
    be allowed to retain personal data for a longer period whenever the user has given consent to such processing, as
    long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, Random Team Generator may be obliged to retain personal data for a longer
    period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority. Once the
    retention period expires, personal data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the
    right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention
    period.
  </p>

    information, accepting the use of cookies by our platform and providing us with personal information to communicate

  </p>

  <h2>6. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below.</p>
  <p>
    Third-Party Service Providers. We use the services of third parties to perform certain functions
    on the platform. For example, create the platform and host the website, send email, analyze data (Google Analytics),
    show advertising within the website, provide marketing services, and provide search results.
  </p>
  <p>
    These third-party services and tools may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but
    may not use that information for other purposes. Information shared with these third-party services will be treated
    and stored in accordance with their respective privacy policies and our privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anonymous Information. Random Team Generator uses the anonymous browsing information collected
    automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve the Platform. We may also use aggregated
    anonymous information to provide information about the Platform to potential business partners and other
    unaffiliated entities. This information is not personally identifiable.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Protecting Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
    software, which encrypts information you input. We restrict authorized access to your personal information to those
    persons who have a legitimate purpose to know that information to provide products or services to you and those
    persons you have authorized to have access to such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Random Team Generator follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us,
    both during transmission and once Picker Wheel receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
    of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Random Team Generator strives to use commercially acceptable means to
    protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or
    are required by law to do so.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Users who provide information through our website, as data subjects and data owners, have the right to access,
    rectify, download, or delete their information, as well as to restrict and object to certain processing of their
    information. While some of these rights apply generally, others apply only in certain limited circumstances. We
    describe these rights below:

      Object: When we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above,
      or in the public interest, you may object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will stop

      necessary for legal reasons.
    </li>
    <li>
      Revoke consent: Where you have previously given your consent, such as to allow us to process
      and store your personal information, you have the right to revoke your consent to the processing and storage of
      your information at any time. For example, you may withdraw your consent by updating your settings. In certain
      cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn your consent if we have a legal basis
      for doing so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Complaint: If you wish to file a complaint about our use of your information (and without
      prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.
