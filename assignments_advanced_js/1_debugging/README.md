# Practice: Specialisation Web

## Time estimation
- This assignment should take about 1 hour.

## Learning goals
* Often the code isn't working as expected. You will learn how to debug code in the browser to solve a runtime error.

## ASSIGNMENT
* Open the folder `exercise_debugging` in Webstorm.
* Try to understand the code in the different files.
* Ask questions if there is something you don't understand.
* Open index.html in the browser. 
* Test the calculator by doing some calculations. Something is not working!
* Try to fix the code by using the debugger in the browser.
* You need a more complex problem? Try exercise_currency_converter.

## EXTRA (more difficult)
1. Open the sub folder `random_team_generator_react` as a separate project in Webstorm and close this project with the assignments.
2. Follow the instructions in the README.md.
